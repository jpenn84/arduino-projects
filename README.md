# arduino-projects
A repo for Arduino projects that I create while learning

This is where my Arduino learning and testing projects will go.

## Run Locally

Some projects will require a header file for sensitive values (e.g., your WiFi SSID and password). Check the individual folder README files for any additional instructions
